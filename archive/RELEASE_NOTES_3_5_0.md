# AI Context Util v3.5.0 - Phase 3.5.0 Release Notes

## 🚀 **Major Release: Advanced Copilot Instructions**

Version 3.5.0 introduces groundbreaking Copilot instruction generation capabilities that transform your project's ESLint rules, Prettier configuration, and framework setup into intelligent, personalized GitHub Copilot instructions.

---

## 🎯 **What's New**

### ✨ **ESLint Rule Translation Engine**
Transform technical ESLint rules into clear, actionable Copilot instructions:

```javascript
// Your ESLint Rule:
"@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "error"

// Generated Copilot Instruction:
"Always use specific types instead of 'any'. When the type is truly unknown, use 'unknown' and add type guards."
```

**Key Features:**
- **50+ Rule Translations**: Comprehensive coverage of TypeScript ESLint rules
- **Smart Categorization**: Groups rules by purpose (Type Safety, Import Organization, etc.)
- **Context Awareness**: Understands rule options and configurations
- **Monorepo Support**: Handles complex workspace structures

### 🎨 **Prettier Configuration Integration**
Convert formatting preferences into readable guidelines:

```json
// Your .prettierrc:
{
  "semi": false,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "printWidth": 100
}

// Generated Instructions:
"- Omit semicolons at the end of statements
- Use single quotes for strings instead of double quotes
- Keep lines under 100 characters"
```

### 👤 **User Override System (Priority 1000)**
Complete control over AI recommendations with highest-priority customizations:

```markdown
### Override: State Management

```typescript
// ❌ AI might suggest: Use signals for all state
// ✅ My preference: Use RxJS observables for complex state
// Reason: Team expertise and existing patterns
```
```

**Features:**
- **Never Overwritten**: Your customizations are always safe
- **Interactive Creation**: Built-in wizard for easy override creation
- **Team Collaboration**: Share architectural decisions via version control
- **Template Library**: Pre-built templates for common scenarios

### 📋 **Intelligent File Management**
Sophisticated priority system and metadata generation:

```yaml
---
applyTo: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"]
priority: 100
framework: angular
version: 17.0.0
confidence: 0.9
tags: [angular-17, control-flow, signals]
---
```

**Generated File Structure:**
```
.github/
├── copilot-instructions.md                     # Main instructions
└── instructions/
    ├── user-overrides.instructions.md          # Priority: 1000 (YOU)
    ├── angular.instructions.md                 # Priority: 100
    ├── typescript.instructions.md              # Priority: 50
    ├── eslint-rules.instructions.md            # Priority: 30
    └── prettier-formatting.instructions.md     # Priority: 20
```

### 🏗️ **Advanced Framework Detection**
Intelligent detection of modern framework features:

- **Angular 17+**: Control flow syntax (`@if`, `@for`), signals, standalone components
- **React 18+**: Server Components, concurrent features, modern hooks
- **Vue 3+**: Composition API, script setup syntax
- **TypeScript 5+**: Decorators, strict mode, advanced types
