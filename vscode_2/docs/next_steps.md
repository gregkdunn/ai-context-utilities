# Next Steps Prompt for AI Debug Context Development

## Current Status
âœ… **COMPLETED**: Test Output Display Feature - Real-time test execution monitoring with streaming output, file management, and comprehensive execution controls is now fully implemented and ready for testing.

## Immediate Action Required
**Test the new feature:**
1. Open `/Users/gregdunn/src/test/ai_debug_context/vscode_2` in VSCode
2. Press F5 to launch Extension Development Host
3. Open an NX workspace in the new window
4. Access AI Debug Context from Activity Bar
5. Navigate to Test Selection module
6. Configure and run tests to see the new real-time output display

## Next Development Phase Priorities

### 1. **PR Description Generation Enhancement** (High Priority)
The PR generator module needs significant enhancement to make it production-ready:

**Needed Features:**
- Jira ticket integration and validation
- Feature flag detection in git diffs (Flipper, feature_flag patterns)
- Template-based PR description generation with Copilot
- Enhanced diff analysis for better PR context
- Integration with the existing git diff and test output features

**Implementation Points:**
- Create JiraIntegration service for ticket validation
- Implement FeatureFlagDetector for diff analysis
- Enhance PRGenerator component with template selection
- Connect with existing GitIntegration and TestRunner results
- Add PR template configuration options

### 2. **End-to-End Workflow Integration** (Medium Priority)
Connect all modules into a cohesive workflow:

**Workflow Steps:**
- File selection â†’ Test execution â†’ AI analysis â†’ PR generation
- Seamless module navigation and data passing
- State preservation between modules
- Comprehensive error handling across workflow

### 3. **Performance and Polish** (Medium Priority)
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Configuration UI for user preferences
- Performance optimizations for large repositories
- Additional test framework support (Vitest, Mocha, etc.)

## Current Architecture Status

### âœ… Fully Implemented Modules
- **Core Extension Infrastructure**: Activity bar, webview provider, messaging
- **Git Integration**: Uncommitted changes, commit diff, branch diff with streaming
- **NX Workspace Manager**: Project detection, affected tests, test file discovery
- **Test Runner**: Enhanced with real-time output streaming and file management
- **Copilot Integration**: AI analysis, test failure debugging, false positive detection
- **File Selection UI**: Complete with all diff modes
- **Test Selection UI**: Enhanced with real-time output display
- **AI Debug UI**: Working with real Copilot integration

### ðŸš§ Partially Implemented
- **PR Generator UI**: Basic structure exists, needs enhancement
- **Git Diff Display**: Implemented but could be better integrated with PR generation

### ðŸ“‹ Next Implementation Tasks
1. **Enhance PR Description Generator**
2. **Add Jira Integration Service**
3. **Implement Feature Flag Detection**
4. **Create End-to-End Workflow Orchestration**
5. **Add Keyboard Shortcuts and Configuration UI**

## Code Quality Status
- **TypeScript Compilation**: âœ… Clean (npm run compile:ts-only)
- **Unit Tests**: âœ… Passing (npm test)
- **Angular Build**: âœ… Working (npm run build:webview)
- **ESLint**: âœ… Clean (npm run lint)
- **Test Coverage**: âœ… Comprehensive for all implemented features

## Testing Commands for Next Session
```bash
cd /Users/gregdunn/src/test/ai_debug_context/vscode_2

# Verify current implementation
npm run compile:ts-only && npm test && npm run build:webview

# Test the extension (recommended)
# 1. Open in VSCode, press F5
# 2. Test new real-time output display feature
# 3. Verify all existing functionality still works

# Run the test script
chmod +x /Users/gregdunn/src/test/temp_scripts/test_output_display_feature.sh
./temp_scripts/test_output_display_feature.sh
```

## Files to Focus on Next
- `webview-ui/src/app/modules/pr-generator/pr-generator.component.ts` - Needs major enhancement
- `src/services/JiraIntegration.ts` - New file to create
- `src/services/FeatureFlagDetector.ts` - New file to create
- `src/services/PRDescriptionGenerator.ts` - New service to create
- Integration between existing modules for end-to-end workflow

**All tests are currently passing. The extension is stable and ready for the next development phase. Focus on PR generation enhancement as the highest priority item.**
