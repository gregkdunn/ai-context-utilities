```bash
cd /Users/gregdunn/src/test/ai_debug_context/vscode_2

# Build and test the implementation
npm run build:webview
npm run compile:ts-only  
npm test

# Test the git diff functionality
chmod +x /Users/gregdunn/src/test/temp_scripts/test_git_diff_implementation.sh
./temp_scripts/test_git_diff_implementation.sh
```
