# 002 - Multiple Commit Selection Feature

## Feature Request
Enhance the git commit selection in the File Selection Module to support multiple commit selection with intelligent range behavior:

- Allow multiple commits to be selected
- Start with the latest commit by default
- If an older commit is selected, automatically select all commits from that commit to the latest commit
- Provide clear visual indication of selected range

## Requirements

### User Experience
1. **Single Click**: Select individual commit
2. **Range Selection**: When clicking an older commit, select all commits from that commit to HEAD
3. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of selected commits and range
4. **Deselection**: Allow users to deselect commits or modify selection
5. **Summary**: Show count of selected commits and range information

### Technical Implementation
1. Update `GitCommit` interface to support selection state
2. Modify component logic to handle multiple selections
3. Implement range selection algorithm
4. Update UI to show selection states visually
5. Update emit logic to handle multiple commits
6. Add comprehensive unit tests

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Update Type Definitions
- Extend `GitCommit` interface with selection property
- Update `FileSelection` interface to handle multiple commits

### Step 2: Update Component Logic
- Add multiple commit selection state management
- Implement range selection algorithm
- Update selection/deselection methods

### Step 3: Update UI Template
- Add visual indicators for selected commits
- Show selection summary
- Update commit click handlers

### Step 4: Update Unit Tests
- Test single commit selection
- Test range selection behavior
- Test deselection functionality
- Test edge cases

### Step 5: Integration Testing
- Verify with real git data
- Test performance with large commit lists
- Validate user experience

## Expected Benefits
- More flexible commit selection for complex diffs
- Better user experience for analyzing commit ranges
- Clearer intent when selecting related commits
- Improved workflow for PR generation from multiple commits

## Implementation Complete

### What Was Implemented
1. **Updated Type Definitions**
   - Added `selected: boolean` to `GitCommit` interface
   - Changed `FileSelection.commit` to `FileSelection.commits` array

2. **Enhanced Component Logic**
   - Added `selectedCommits` signal for multiple selection tracking
   - Implemented `selectCommit()` with range selection logic
   - Added `selectCommitRange()` and `deselectCommitAndAfter()` helper methods
   - Added `clearCommitSelection()` method
   - Updated `updateSelectedCommits()` to sync state

3. **Improved UI Template**
   - Added instruction text explaining multi-selection behavior
   - Added clear selection button with count indicator
   - Added visual selection indicators (checkmarks, borders)
   - Updated commit styling for selected state

4. **Enhanced Methods**
   - Updated `hasValidSelection()` to check for multiple commits
   - Enhanced `getSelectionSummary()` with smart range display
   - Updated `getCurrentDiff()` to handle commit ranges
   - Modified all data handling methods to support selection state

5. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Added 6 new unit tests specifically for multi-commit selection
   - Tests cover range selection, deselection, clearing, and edge cases
   - All existing tests updated to support new interfaces

### User Experience Features
- **Intuitive Range Selection**: Click any commit to select from latest to that commit
- **Smart Deselection**: Click selected commit to deselect it and all after it
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators showing selected commits with checkmarks and borders
- **Selection Summary**: Shows count and range of selected commits
- **Clear All**: Easy button to clear entire selection
