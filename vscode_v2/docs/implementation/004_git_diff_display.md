## Git Diff Display Module Implementation

### Overview
Implemented a comprehensive Git Diff display module that provides real-time streaming output and file management capabilities. This module integrates seamlessly with the existing file selection system and provides a dedicated screen for viewing and managing git diff outputs.

### Features Implemented

#### 1. Git Diff Display Component
- **Real-time streaming output** during diff generation
- **Live progress indicators** with status updates
- **Content display** with syntax-aware formatting
- **File management controls** (open, delete, copy)
- **Expandable/collapsible view** for large diffs
- **Line wrapping toggle** for better readability

#### 2. Enhanced GitIntegration Service
- **Streaming diff generation** with progress callbacks
- **File operations** (save to workspace, open in VSCode, delete)
- **Workspace diff directory management** (`.ai-debug-context/diffs/`)
- **Support for all diff modes**:
  - Uncommitted changes
  - Specific commit diffs
  - Branch-to-main diffs

#### 3. File Selection Integration
- **"View Diff" button** added to file selection module
- **Loading states** during diff generation
- **Error handling** with user feedback
- **Automatic navigation** to diff view when generated

#### 4. Navigation Integration
- **New module type** added to main app component
- **State management** for git diff data
- **Back navigation** to overview or file selection
- **Persistent state** across module switches

### Technical Implementation

#### Backend (GitIntegration Service)
```typescript
async generateDiffWithStreaming(
  mode: 'uncommitted' | 'commit' | 'branch-diff',
  commitHash?: string,
  outputCallback?: (output: string) => void
): Promise<{ content: string; filePath: string }>
```

Key features:
- Progress streaming via callbacks
- Automatic file naming with timestamps
- Workspace directory management
- Error handling with detailed messages

#### Frontend (GitDiffComponent)
```typescript
interface GitDiffDisplayData {
  mode: 'uncommitted' | 'commit' | 'branch-diff';
  content: string;
  filePath?: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  status: 'running' | 'complete' | 'error';
  error?: string;
}
```

Key features:
- Signal-based reactivity for real-time updates
- Message-driven communication with backend
- Comprehensive UI states (loading, complete, error)
- Accessibility considerations

#### Message Protocol
New VSCode messages:
- `generateGitDiff` - Request diff generation
- `gitDiffProgress` - Streaming output updates
- `gitDiffComplete` - Diff generation completed
- `gitDiffError` - Error during generation
- `rerunGitDiff` - Regenerate existing diff
- `openDiffFile` - Open diff file in VSCode
- `deleteDiffFile` - Delete diff file from workspace
- `gitDiffFileDeleted` - Confirmation of file deletion

### User Workflow

1. **File Selection**: User selects files/commits in file selection module
2. **Generate Diff**: User clicks "View Diff" button
3. **Live Streaming**: Real-time output appears during generation
4. **Diff Display**: Complete diff appears with management options
5. **File Operations**: User can open, copy, or delete the diff file
6. **Navigation**: User can return to other modules or regenerate

### Testing Coverage

#### Unit Tests
- ✅ GitDiffComponent - 25+ test cases covering all functionality
- ✅ File selection integration tests
- ✅ Message handling verification
- ✅ State management validation
- ✅ Error scenario coverage

#### Integration Points
- Main app component navigation
- GitIntegration service streaming
- VSCode file operations
- Clipboard API integration

### File Structure
```
webview-ui/src/app/modules/git-diff/
├── git-diff.component.ts        # Main component implementation
└── git-diff.component.spec.ts   # Comprehensive unit tests

src/services/
└── GitIntegration.ts            # Enhanced with streaming and file ops

webview-ui/src/app/
└── app.component.ts             # Updated with git-diff navigation
```

### Benefits

1. **Real-time Feedback**: Users see progress as diffs are generated
2. **File Management**: Diffs are saved and can be managed from UI
3. **Developer Experience**: Quick access to diff content for AI analysis
4. **Integration**: Seamless workflow from file selection to diff viewing
5. **Extensibility**: Foundation for future diff-related features

### Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Verify functionality in VSCode Development Host (F5)
2. **Performance**: Test with large repositories and diffs
3. **Polish**: Add syntax highlighting for diff content
4. **Enhancement**: Consider diff comparison features
5. **Documentation**: Add user-facing documentation

### Architecture Impact

This implementation follows the established modular architecture:
- **Standalone Angular components** with signal-based reactivity
- **Service-oriented backend** with clear separation of concerns
- **Message-based communication** between frontend and extension
- **Type-safe interfaces** throughout the stack
- **Comprehensive testing** at all levels

The git diff module integrates seamlessly with existing modules and provides a foundation for future enhancements to the diff viewing and analysis capabilities.
