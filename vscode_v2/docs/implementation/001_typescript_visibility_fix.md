# 001 - TypeScript Visibility Fix

## Issue
The `FileSelectorComponent` had a TypeScript compilation error where the `isLoadingData` property was declared as private but was being accessed in the Angular template.

## Error Details
```
Property 'isLoadingData' is private and only accessible within class 'FileSelectorComponent'.
```

This error occurred in 5 locations in the template:
- Line 75: `@if (isLoadingData())`
- Line 122: `@if (isLoadingData())`
- Line 184: `@if (isLoadingData())`
- Line 214: `[disabled]="isLoadingData()"`
- Line 216: `@if (isLoadingData())`

## Solution Applied
Changed the property declaration from private to public:

```typescript
// Before
private isLoadingData = signal<boolean>(false);

// After  
isLoadingData = signal<boolean>(false);
```

## Impact
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- ✅ Template can now access the loading state signal
- ✅ Component functionality remains unchanged
- ✅ Unit tests continue to pass

## Files Modified
- `/webview-ui/src/app/modules/file-selection/file-selector.component.ts`

## Testing
This fix allows the Angular template to properly access the loading state signal for displaying loading indicators throughout the UI.
