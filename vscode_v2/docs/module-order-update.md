# Module Order Update - Main Page Layout

## Change Summary
Moved the `prepare_to_push` module below the `analysis_dashboard` on the main page to create a more logical workflow progression.

## New Module Order

### Before:
1. 📝 **file_selection** - Select changes from source
2. 🧪 **test_selection** - Configure NX test execution  
3. 🤖 **ai_test_debug** - AI-powered analysis workflow
4. 🚀 **prepare_to_push** - Validate code quality
5. ~~📋 pr_generator~~ *(hidden for demo)*
6. 🧠 **analysis_dashboard** - Comprehensive analysis

### After:
1. 📝 **file_selection** - Select changes from source
2. 🧪 **test_selection** - Configure NX test execution  
3. 🤖 **ai_test_debug** - AI-powered analysis workflow
4. 🧠 **analysis_dashboard** - Comprehensive analysis ⬆️ *moved up*
5. 🚀 **prepare_to_push** - Validate code quality ⬇️ *moved down*

## Rationale for New Order

### **Logical Workflow Progression**
```
File Selection → Test Configuration → AI Analysis → Analysis Dashboard → Code Quality Check
```

### **Benefits of New Order**

1. **Analysis First Approach**: 
   - Users get comprehensive AI insights before final validation
   - Analysis Dashboard provides detailed recommendations and diagnostics
   - Natural progression from AI analysis to viewing results

2. **Better User Journey**:
   - **Setup Phase**: File selection + Test configuration
   - **Analysis Phase**: AI debugging + Results dashboard  
   - **Validation Phase**: Code quality preparation

3. **Decision Making Flow**:
   - See analysis results and recommendations first
   - Make any necessary code changes based on insights
   - Then validate final code quality before pushing

4. **Troubleshooting Workflow**:
   - Analysis Dashboard shows system diagnostics (Copilot status)
   - Users can resolve issues before final validation
   - Prepare to Push becomes the final "ready to ship" check

## Updated UI Structure

### Analysis Dashboard (Position 4)
```
🧠 analysis_dashboard --comprehensive

Submit your complete AI context to Copilot for comprehensive 
analysis, insights, and recommendations with persistent results.

Status: Ready for comprehensive analysis

[🚀 LAUNCH --analysis-dashboard]
```

### Prepare to Push (Position 5) 
```
🚀 prepare_to_push --validate

Run linting and formatting on your selected projects to ensure 
code quality before pushing.

Status: {{ getPrepareToPushStatus() }}

[✨ VALIDATE --code-quality] or [✗ REQUIRES --project-selection]
```

## Impact on Demo Flow

The new order creates a more intuitive demo narrative:

1. **"Let me show you our file selection..."** (Setup)
2. **"Configure which tests to run..."** (Setup) 
3. **"Run AI analysis to find issues..."** (Analysis)
4. **"View comprehensive results and diagnostics..."** (Review)
5. **"Finally, validate code quality before pushing..."** (Validation)

This progression feels more natural and puts the Analysis Dashboard in a prominent position to showcase the troubleshooting features we've built for Copilot connectivity issues.
