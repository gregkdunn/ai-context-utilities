## <span class="terminal-prompt">$</span> I asked the AI:

**How can I get better Angular code suggestions in Copilot?**

> <span class="ai-response">ü§ñ : Just add more **Context**.</span>

---

<div class="_break"></div>

---

# <span class="terminal-prompt">></span> Context

**What is it?**

- **Your Code**
- **What changed?**
- **What's broken?**
- **Framework reference**
- **Best Practices**
- **Any relevant info**

### The more context the AI has, the better suggestions it will give you.

<div class="_break"></div>

## üìê Adding Angular Context

**Recently, Angular released files to help add more context to Code suggestions.**

- **Angular LLMs Resource**
  - A resource for LLMs to understand Angular. Basically, the entire Angular documentation website in a single file.

- **Angular Best Practices Prompt**
  - Simple prompts to get more modern suggestions and fix issues that keep popping up

---

<div class="_break"></div>

---

## <span class="terminal-prompt">$</span> DEMO

**Let's look at the contents**

---

<div class="_break"></div>

---

## How to use them with Copilot?

1. **Save both files** to the `.github/instructions/` directory

2. **Click Add Context**

3. **Select your files**

4. **Copilot is now a master level Angular dev**

## AI Talking Points

### 1. ‚ú® Ensures AI-Generated Code Follows Angular Best Practices

- **Consistent Code Style:** Structured approaches to components, naming, and organization
- **Modern Angular Patterns:** Signals, standalone components, cutting-edge features
- **Performance Optimization:** OnPush and avoiding anti-patterns

### 2. üîÑ Aligns with Angular's Latest Recommendations

- **Signal-Based Approach:** Embracing the future with signal-based APIs
- **Standalone Components:** Breaking free from NgModule constraints
- **Native Control Flow:** @if/@for FTW, leaving *ngIf/*ngFor in the past

### 3. üß© Provides Specific Angular Domain Knowledge

- **Angular-Specific Techniques:** Content projection, styling, and selectors
- **Framework-Aware Code Generation:** Code that understands Angular's soul
- **More Than Syntax:** Architectural guidance specific to Angular applications

# üìã Adding Testing Context

---

<div class="_break"></div>

---

## <span class="terminal-prompt">$</span> I asked the AI:

**What would increase efficiency in debugging failing tests?**
> <span class="ai-response">ü§ñ : **Context** is key.</span>

**What if I provide the latest changes?**
> <span class="ai-response">ü§ñ : That would let me know what you did.</span>

**What if I provide the latest test run?**
> <span class="ai-response">ü§ñ : That would tell me what you messed up.</span>

**How about a link to the Jira ticket?**
> <span class="ai-response">ü§ñ : I don't mess with Jira.</span>

---

<div class="_break"></div>

---

## <span class="terminal-prompt">></span> The Problem
 I could :  
- run git diff and copy the output.
- Then run jest and copy that output.

 **`But that just became tedious...`** 
---

<div class="_break"></div>

---



## <span class="terminal-prompt">></span> My Solution

- I worked with **GPT, Gemini and Claude** to write a script
- I liked **Claude's approach** the best
- We created an **`.ai_utilities`** script file to help automate the process`**

---

<div class="_break"></div>

---

## The Utility Functions

**It has 3 functions:**

### üìÇ **gitDiff**
- Uses git diff to save your current code changes to a file
- AI added all sorts of error handling

### üß™ **nxTest**
- Runs Jest tests for NX projects, folders or a single file
- Added console formatting to make it easier to read
- Saves output to a file

### üîç **aiDebug**
- Adds helpful prompts to the header
- Combines gitDiff and nxTest into a single file
- Suggests how to use the output file

---

<div class="_break"></div>

---

## Demo 

*How you use aiDebug in 7 easy steps*

<br/>

<br/>

**1.** Find a branch with broken tests ü§∑


<br/>

**2.** Run the aiDebug command on your project in the terminal

*Example using settings-voice-assist-feature:*

```
aiDebug settings-voice-assist-feature
```

**If tests fail, you'll see output like this:**
```
‚ùå Tests failed with exit code: 1
==========================================================
The following debug files have been generated:
- Git diff: .github/instructions/diff.txt
- Test report: .github/instructions/jest-output.txt
- Combined context: .github/instructions/ai-debug-context.txt (recommended)

======================================
üìã BEST WAY TO GET AI HELP WITH TEST FAILURES
======================================
```

---

<div class="_break"></div>

---

## Demo - Steps 3-7

**3. Huzzah!** You now have a context file to help AI debug your tests

<br/>

**4. Add the context file to Copilot:**

   - Select `.github/instructions/ai-debug-context.txt`
   - This file includes both your code changes and test failures

   or 

   - Create a new file in the `.github/instructions/copilot-instructions.md file that includes the a link to the context file!

<br/>

**5. Ask Copilot to look at the context file:**
```
Can you help debug test failures based on the ai-debug-context file?
```

<br/>

**6. Read the nicely tailored response:**
   - Analysis of what's breaking the tests
   - Suggested fixes for each failing test
   - Explanation of root causes
   - Additional test cases if needed

<br/>

**7. Decide on the best approach**

Then for Extra Credit, 

Claude and I worked together to create a 
VSCode extension that automates the process of gathering context.

-  It's stil rough around the edges, but it works!


**Demo the VSCode Extension**

Fill the awkward silence

## <span class="terminal-prompt">$</span> I asked the AI:

**Tell me a Frontend Developer Joke:**

**Q:** What's a frontend developer's favorite sandwich?  
**A:** One with lots of layers and proper DOM manipulation.

### In conclusion, **Comedy** is still a safe career choice.

---

<div class="_break"></div>

---

This is v2:

- v1 got out of control and was too complex

- Just approved everything and let him run wild

** I ended up with 600 broken tests
and Claude build a Plugin Marketplace so I could 
open up my own store? **

<div class="_break"></div>

### AI Talking Points

#### 1. üîÑ Streamlined Testing and Debugging Workflow
- **Single Command Execution:** One command (aiDebug) to rule them all
- **Automatic Context Collection:** No more manual diff gathering
- **Time Savings:** Turn 10 minutes of work into 10 seconds

#### 2. ü§ù Enhanced Collaboration with AI Assistants
- **AI-Optimized Outputs:** Perfectly structured context for AI consumption
- **Built-in Prompting:** Self-explanatory context files that guide AI responses
- **Reduced Context-Switching:** Stay focused on solving, not explaining

#### 3. üìã Consistent and Well-Formatted Output
- **Clean, Readable Test Reports:** Beautiful test outputs, every time
- **Organized Structure:** Clear section headers make navigation a breeze
- **Complete Context:** Tests + code changes = root cause insights
