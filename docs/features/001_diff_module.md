# Feature Specification: DIFF Module (File Selection)

**Module Name**: DIFF Module  
**Component**: `FileSelectorComponent`  
**Backend Services**: `GitIntegration.ts`  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Version**: 2.0.0

## 🎯 Purpose

The DIFF Module provides intelligent git change analysis and file selection capabilities, allowing users to choose which code changes to include in their AI debugging context. It serves as the foundation for all other modules by providing the code change context.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality

#### 1. File Selection Modes
**Three distinct modes for different workflows:**

1. **Uncommitted Changes Mode**
   - Shows all uncommitted files in working directory
   - Individual file selection with checkboxes
   - Real-time status display (added, modified, deleted)
   - File count and change statistics

2. **Commit Selection Mode**  
   - Browse commit history with search functionality
   - Revolutionary multi-commit range selection
   - Commit details (hash, message, author, date)
   - Integrated diff preview for selected commits

3. **Branch Diff Mode**
   - Compare current branch to main/base branch
   - Automatic branch detection
   - Comprehensive change statistics
   - All changes selected automatically

#### 2. Advanced UX Features

**Multi-Commit Selection Innovation**:
- Click first commit → click second commit → automatic range selection
- Visual indicators for selected range
- Smart range validation and feedback
- Undo/clear selection functionality

**Real-time Diff Generation**:
- Live diff preview as selections change
- Syntax highlighting for diff output
- Collapsible diff sections for large changes
- Smart diff formatting for AI consumption

**State Management**:
- Automatic diff clearing when selections change
- Persistent selection across module switches
- Smart validation and error handling
- Loading states and progress indicators

### Technical Implementation

#### Frontend Component (`FileSelectorComponent`)
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-file-selector',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, FormsModule],
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class FileSelectorComponent {
  // Signal-based state management
  selectionMode = signal<'uncommitted' | 'commit' | 'branch-diff'>('uncommitted');
  uncommittedFiles = signal<FileStatus[]>([]);
  commits = signal<GitCommit[]>([]);
  selectedCommits = signal<GitCommit[]>([]);
  currentDiff = signal<string>('');
  
  // Advanced multi-commit selection logic
  handleCommitSelection(commit: GitCommit) {
    // Revolutionary range selection implementation
  }
  
  // Real-time diff generation
  generateDiff() {
    // Integrated diff generation and display
  }
}
```

#### Backend Service (`GitIntegration.ts`)
```typescript
export class GitIntegration {
  // Advanced git operations
  async getUncommittedChanges(): Promise<FileStatus[]>;
  async getCommitHistory(limit?: number): Promise<GitCommit[]>;
  async getDiffFromMainBranch(): Promise<string>;
  async getDiffForCommits(commits: GitCommit[]): Promise<string>;
  async getDiffForCommitRange(from: string, to: string): Promise<string>;
}
```

## 🎨 User Interface

### Visual Design

🤖 AI ANALYSIS CONTEXT
=================================================================
Key areas for analysis:
• Focus on test-related files (.spec.ts, .test.ts)
• Look for type/interface changes that might break tests
• Check for new functionality that needs test coverage
• Identify breaking changes in method signatures
• Review dependency changes and imports
```
