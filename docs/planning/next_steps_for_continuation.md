# Next Steps: Complete Test Fixes and Implement Core Features

## Current Status Summary

We have successfully:
‚úÖ **Created VSCode Extension v2.0 boilerplate** with Angular/Tailwind UI  
‚úÖ **Implemented core service architecture** (GitIntegration, CopilotIntegration, TestRunner, NXWorkspaceManager)  
‚úÖ **Set up comprehensive testing framework** with Jest and VSCode API mocking  
‚úÖ **Identified and partially fixed test failures** (30 failed ‚Üí ~15 remaining)  
‚úÖ **Created project documentation** and implementation tracking  

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority 1)

### 1. Complete Unit Test Fixes üß™
The test suite has 4 main issues that need resolution:

**A. GitIntegration Tests (6 failing)**
- Issue: Mock timing and async setup problems  
- Status: 50% fixed - workspace mocks added, mock reset improved
- Next: Complete async mock handling for `revparse` and `status` methods

**B. CopilotIntegration Tests (12 failing)**
- Issue: VSCode Language Model API complex mocking
- Status: Structure identified, needs mock simplification
- Next: Create proper async generator mocks for `sendRequest` responses

**C. Extension Tests (4 failing)**  
- Issue: Service registration disposable expectations
- Status: 75% fixed - disposable mocks added
- Next: Fix command registration and subscription management mocks

**D. TestRunner Tests (5 failing)**
- Issue: ChildProcess spawn event simulation complexity
- Status: Lint warnings fixed, core mocking needs refactor
- Next: Simplify process mock to focus on essential stdout/stderr behavior

### 2. Verify Extension Functionality üîå
After tests pass:
- Test extension activation in VSCode development host
- Verify webview loads with Angular UI
- Test basic service initialization and communication
- Validate configuration settings

## Phase 1 Implementation (After Test Completion)

### 3. DIFF Module Implementation üìã
**Goal**: File selection and git diff generation UI
- **File Selection Component**: Uncommitted, commit, branch-diff modes
- **Smart Diff Strategy**: Auto-detect best diff approach  
- **Diff Display**: Syntax-highlighted diff view with file categorization
- **Output Management**: Save diff files with cleanup utilities

### 4. TEST Module Implementation üß™
**Goal**: Test project selection and execution with real-time output
- **Project Selection UI**: NX project dropdown with affected tests option
- **Test Execution**: Real-time streaming output with progress indicators
- **Results Parsing**: Parse Jest/NX test output into structured results
- **Output Files**: Save test results with timestamps and cleanup

### 5. AI TEST DEBUG Workflow ü§ñ
**Goal**: Combine diff and test results for AI analysis
- **Context Generation**: Merge git diff + test results into AI-optimized context
- **Copilot Integration**: Send structured prompts for failure analysis
- **Result Processing**: Parse AI responses into actionable recommendations
- **UI Display**: Show analysis results with fix suggestions and new test recommendations

### 6. PR DESCRIPTION Generator üìù  
**Goal**: Auto-generate GitHub PR descriptions from analysis
- **Template System**: Support multiple PR templates (feature, bugfix, hotfix)
- **Jira Integration**: Extract and validate Jira ticket references
- **Feature Flag Detection**: Scan diff for feature flags and include in description
- **AI Generation**: Use Copilot to create comprehensive PR descriptions

## Technical Implementation Priority

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. **Fix remaining test failures** - Critical for development confidence
2. **Verify extension loads in VSCode** - Validate basic functionality  
3. **Set up development workflow** - Hot reload, debugging, testing

### Phase 1 (Week 2-3)
4. **Implement DIFF module** - Foundation for all other features
5. **Implement TEST module** - Core testing functionality
6. **Basic AI integration** - Simple Copilot prompts and responses

### Phase 2 (Week 4)  
7. **Complete AI TEST DEBUG workflow** - Full analysis pipeline
8. **PR DESCRIPTION generation** - End-to-end automation
9. **Polish and optimization** - Performance, UX, error handling

## Key Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Continue test fixes
cd /Users/gregdunn/src/test/ai_debug_context/vscode_2
npm test                                    # Check current test status
npx jest src/__tests__/GitIntegration.test.ts --verbose  # Focus on specific tests

# Development workflow  
npm run watch                               # Hot reload development
code .                                      # Open in VSCode
F5                                         # Launch Extension Development Host

# Individual test debugging
npx jest src/__tests__/CopilotIntegration.test.ts --no-coverage --verbose
```

## Files Requiring Immediate Attention

1. **`src/__tests__/GitIntegration.test.ts`** - Complete async mock fixes
2. **`src/__tests__/CopilotIntegration.test.ts`** - Simplify API mocking  
3. **`src/__tests__/extension.test.ts`** - Fix registration expectations
4. **`src/__tests__/TestRunner.test.ts`** - Refactor process mocking

## Success Criteria for Next Session

- [ ] All unit tests passing (target: 0 failures)
- [ ] Extension successfully activates in VSCode  
- [ ] Basic webview UI loads with Angular components
- [ ] Development workflow established (watch, debug, test)
- [ ] Ready to begin DIFF module implementation

## Context for AI Assistant

Please focus on completing the test fixes first before implementing any new features. The current test failures are blocking development progress and need to be resolved with proper mocking strategies. Once tests pass, we can proceed with implementing the core DIFF and TEST modules.

**Priority**: Fix tests ‚Üí Verify extension works ‚Üí Implement DIFF module ‚Üí Implement TEST module ‚Üí AI integration
