# PR Description Override Instructions

## üéØ PURPOSE
This file allows you to customize the PR description generation prompt with your own high-priority instructions.
These instructions will be used FIRST when generating PR descriptions, overriding the default behavior.

## üìù YOUR CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS
<!-- Edit the section below with your preferred PR description style and requirements -->

### Required Style
- Use concise, bullet-point format for all sections
- Start Summary with "This PR..." 
- Keep descriptions under 500 words total
- Use present tense throughout

### Content Requirements
1. **Summary**: One sentence maximum describing the change
2. **Technical Changes**: List files modified with brief explanation
3. **Testing**: Include specific test commands that were run
4. **Impact**: Describe who this affects and how
5. **Screenshots**: Request screenshots for any UI changes

### Tone and Voice
- Professional but conversational
- Avoid jargon where possible
- Focus on "why" not just "what"

### Special Instructions
- If feature flags are detected, create a dedicated "Feature Flag Testing" section
- For bug fixes, include "Root Cause" section
- For performance improvements, include metrics/benchmarks

### Template Override Example
```markdown
