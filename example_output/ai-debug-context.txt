ðŸ“‹ DEBUGGING CONTEXT FOR AI ASSISTANT
=================================================================

I'm seeing test failures in my Angular NX monorepo project. Can you help debug these issues?

Context:
- The test results and code changes are provided below
- Looking for a clear fix and explanation of what's breaking

Please provide:
1. An analysis of what's breaking the tests
2. A clear fix for each failing test
3. Any additional tests needed for the new functionality
