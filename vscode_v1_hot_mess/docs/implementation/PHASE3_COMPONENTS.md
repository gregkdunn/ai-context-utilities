  [executionId]="currentExecutionId()"
  [isStreaming]="isStreaming()"
  (fileOpened)="onFileOpened($event)"
  (fileDownloaded)="onFileDownloaded($event)"
  (outputCleared)="onOutputCleared()">
</app-results-viewer>
```

### ProgressIndicator Configuration
```typescript
<app-progress-indicator
  [compact]="true"
  [showStatistics]="true"
  [showQueue]="true">
</app-progress-indicator>
```

### Toast Service Usage
```typescript
// Success notification
this.toastService.showSuccess('Command Complete', 'AI Debug analysis finished');

// Error with action
this.toastService.showError('Command Failed', 'Network error occurred', [
  { label: 'Retry', action: () => this.retryCommand() }
]);
```
